# ML-Price-Prediction-Analysiis
This code focuses on predicting changes in housing prices using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and feature analysis to create a predictive model. The data is collected from various sources, including economic indicators and housing market data. The main steps include merging datasets, handling missing values, and creating adjusted price values based on inflation. The core of the code involves utilizing a RandomForestClassifier to predict whether housing prices will increase or decrease in the next quarter. The model's accuracy is evaluated, and important features affecting predictions are identified. Visualization techniques are employed to present the results, highlighting accurate and inaccurate predictions.
